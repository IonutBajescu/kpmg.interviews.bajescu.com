# KPMG Code Challenges
Each individual challenge has a README.md in it explaining my approach and possible shortcuts that I had to take due to time constraints.

## Monorepo vs Multiple Repositories
Normally, each app would be in a different repository. To make it easier for the person reviewing the result though, I'll keep everything in a single repository.

## Challenge 2
As Challenge 2 requires the use of an AWS account, which even for the free trial would require a debit card attached, I've decided not to complete it.

The metadata API can be accessed at http://169.254.169.254, and I've used it in my last role. In the challenge1/application/main.go you can see me doing an HTTP request proving that I could easily call it.

I'm happy to complete challenge2 if an AWS spot instance can be provided for me to test it on, but I doubt that'd be required.
